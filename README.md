# Cloud-Based Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning and Scalable AWS Infrastructure

A real-time, cloud-native skin cancer detection system using a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), built on the AWS AI ecosystem and accessible via a Streamlit interface. This end-to-end solution demonstrates how deep learning and serverless infrastructure can be combined to deliver scalable, low-latency, and cost-effective healthcare tools.

## üß† Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer, with over 1.5 million cases reported annually. This project addresses the need for accessible early diagnosis using:

- A **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model from Hugging Face
- Deployed on **Amazon SageMaker**
- Triggered by **AWS Lambda**
- Served via **Streamlit**
- Integrated with **Amazon S3** and **CloudWatch**

This architecture aligns with the AWS Well-Architected Framework and uses scalable, serverless design principles.

## üß™ How It Works

1. **User uploads an image** via the Streamlit app
2. Image is saved to **S3 (`uploads/`)**
3. **S3 event triggers** the Lambda function
4. Lambda:
   - Converts image to RGB
   - Resizes to 224√ó224
   - Sends image to SageMaker
5. **SageMaker ViT model** classifies the image into 7 skin condition categories
6. Prediction (JSON) is saved in S3 (`predictions/`) and shown in the UI
