# Cloud-Based Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning and AWS

A cloud-native AI pipeline for detecting skin cancer from dermatoscopic images using a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) model. This project integrates AWS Lambda, SageMaker, S3, and Streamlit to provide real-time predictions via a lightweight, scalable architecture.

## üß† Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers globally, and early detection is crucial. This project automates the diagnosis process using a pretrained ViT model deployed on AWS. Users interact via a Streamlit frontend and receive predictions in real time.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Model**: Vision Transformer (HuggingFace)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Cloud Services**: 
  - Amazon S3 (image & result storage)
  - AWS Lambda (image preprocessing, inference trigger)
  - Amazon SageMaker (model hosting)
  - AWS CloudWatch (monitoring/logging)

## üß™ How It Works

1. User uploads an image via Streamlit
2. Image is saved to S3 (`uploads/` folder)
3. S3 event triggers the Lambda function:
   - Converts image to RGB
   - Resizes to 224x224
   - Sends payload to SageMaker endpoint
4. ViT model returns prediction as JSON
5. Output is saved to `predictions/` in S3 and shown in the app
